# facebook clone
A facebook clone project made it on **React + Vite**⚡.

Mostly the front-end, if all goes as planned it can end up being fullstack MERN project with express + graphql + mongoDB in the backend side... we'll see.

>pd: The project is in spanish language, but if people show interest i can translate it to english.
